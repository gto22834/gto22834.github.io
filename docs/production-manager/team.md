1. Fleep is an open network so you can chat with anyone else who is on Fleep. If you need to be a member of several projects or teams, you only need one account, whereas in Slack belonging to several teams would mean several accounts.

2. Fleep is free to use if you don’t require admin controls over your company’s accounts & conversations. The “Fleep for Business” package is €5 per user.

3. Fleep also features an unlimited message history as well as unlimited integrations in its free package.
